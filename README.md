A C++ project developed using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, aiming to create a Hospital Management System. The system includes various features such as different types of doctors with distinct appointment slots for patients, as well as laboratory facilities. Patients can schedule appointments based on available slots, and the cases may vary depending on the specialization of the doctors. The project utilizes OOP concepts to create a comprehensive Hospital Management System.
